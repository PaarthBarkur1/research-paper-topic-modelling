# research-paper-topic-modelling
This Project aims as using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify research papers into subcategories based on abstracts provided during submission. This uses techniques like data-preprocessing, tokenization, lemmatization, word2vec etc to try and get an accurate model. We also compare the performance of 4 algorithms on the same dataset.
